# Phrase Hunter

## Overview

Phrase Hunter is Project 3 of Team Treehouse's Python Web Development Techdegree.

The object is to create and run a command line game using only objects and method calls. We were provided blank class files for character, phrase, game, and a blank file to run the game - app.py. We were also given instructions on each section, but the exact design and implementation was up to us.

## Requirements to run the game

- Phrase Hunter only uses the Python Standard Library
- Created with Python 3.7.3

## To Play the game

- Clone the repo to your computer
- Run `python3 app.py` from the root of the cloned folder

## What I learned

- Creating Python Objects, instantiation, methods, and attributes
- Importing and using separate module files
- Breaking the requirements into chuncks and programming/testing a piece at at time
